          <h3>WHY ALT SCHOOL</h3>
          <p>
            I chose to pursue my Cloud Engineering Diploma at Alt School for
            several key reasons. First, Alt School has an excellent reputation
            for providing hands-on, project-based learning focused on current
            technologies and real-world skills. The cloud engineering curriculum
            is developed in partnership with leading tech companies like Amazon
            Web Services, so I know I'm learning skills that are in high demand.
            Additionally, Alt School's flexible online format allows me to
            continue working while earning my diploma. The combination of
            self-paced lessons, live classes, and 1:1 mentorship provides
            support and accountability. I appreciate being able to fit my
            coursework around my schedule. Most importantly, Alt School's focus
            on career development stood out to me. From day one, we work on
            building a professional portfolio and practice soft skills needed in
            the workplace. The career coaching and connections to employers give
            me confidence that this program will lead to new job opportunities
            after graduation.
